title: About Lord Simeon
---

<h2>Early Years</h2>
<p>
    Lord Edward Constantine Simeon III, Esq. was born in Sandwich, England in 1716. He grew up and went to Trinity
    College, Cambridge where he met and befriended John Montagu. There, they became fast friends. After college, Lord
    Simeon decided to become an explorer and befriended some Spanish royals who decided to fund his expeditions.
    Although at this time much of the New World has been discovered, there were still rumors of undiscovered people
    and treasures in the parts now know as Mexico.

<h2>Exploration</h2>
<p>
    In the Summer of 1736, he departed from Spain on his ship "El Burrito" for the Americas, where he landed in the
    Fall of that same year. He and his crew hiked through the jungles of Mexico in search for this treasure. Eventually
    in the Spring of 1737, he discovered a new tribe of people, where he quickly became friends. As he met them he
    observed that they were eating cheese, beef, pork "carnitas" and lettuce out of dirt bowls with their bare hands.
    This gave him an idea!

<h2>The Cylindrical Sandwich</h2>
<p>
    A while back in England, his friend John Montagu invented the sandwich by putting two pieces of bread with a slice
    of cheese and some meat. So he decided to cook up some Tortas to use as the bread. However, he was not a great
    baker, so the tortas never rose instead they laid flat. Upon seeing this, he called this bread "tortilla" for
    "little torta". Lord Simeon then took the ingredients from this tribe of people and wrapped them in this tortilla.
    Thus the Cylindrical Sandwich was invented.

<p>
    Just after he took his first bite, a fight broke out in the tribe. They were being attacked and overrun by the
    Egyptians. Lord Simeon was in flight trying to make it back to ship. While he was fleeing, he noticed that his
    food was still encased in this "tortilla". He was able to run and eat at the same time. Once he got back to ship,
    he decided he must sail back to Europe to deliver the good news.
